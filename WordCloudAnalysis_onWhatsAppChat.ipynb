By the foregoing definition, he is more mathematical than a mathematician, more scientific than a scientist, more logical than a lawyer, and more creative than an artist. Having successfully covered virtually all topics in mathematics, science, and also covered the fundamentals of law, humanities, management and religion.\\nIt is however regrettable that the engineer is highly neglected by the government of Nigeria, such that the joy and morale of an engineer has almost dropped to the baseline, reducing the graduate engineer to a mere classroom teacher, artisans traders and many more unbecoming jobs to earn a living after graduation. This is unlike his pars in Medicine and Law who are given their staff of office by their automatic adoption into their professional cadre immediately after graduation with a lot of fanfare and cheers.\\nIn the second year of engineering studies, the undergraduate engineer is taught that, engineering regulations in Nigeria does not permit him to bear the title ‘’Engr” after graduation until at least 5years, then he can sit for an exam - if recommended by Nigerian Society of Engineers(NSE). If he passes the exam, then he qualifies to practice engineering with all privileges. Making it a total of 10years to become an engineer in Nigeria- yet there are no airplanes, ships, cars, machines built by a Nigerian engineer till today. When I asked, I was told that the idea is to reduce quackery and avoid the building of substandard structures – Yet there are substandard structures everywhere, and there are quacks everywhere too. But when I checked Medicine which deals directly with human life, this stringent condition does not apply. Even undergraduate medical doctors attain to patients in the clinic- that is why they have university teaching hospital. In law, which deals with justice, this undue strictness does not also apply, everyone knows that there are incompetent lawyers and judges everywhere in Nigeria- that is why there is Appeal to cases and judgements.\\nI, Graduate Engineer Abbah Rufus, on behalf of all concerned undergraduate and graduate engineers in Nigeria, make the following suggestions, submission, appeal, or demands as the case may be, to the Nigerian Government:\\n1. COREN should be reformed immediately to allow immediate adoption of graduate engineers into the engineering profession with all privileges, either automatically or with lesser conditions.\\n2. The national Assembly should initiate a bill to make a law that will establish Engineering Institute, that will be regulated by COREN. This institute will have the responsibility to prepare the graduate engineer for professionalism.\\n3. There should be Engineer General of the Federation. Who is to among other functions, be the Chief Adviser to the government on Engineering, Technology and Industry issues.  Just like there is Attorney General of the Federation, Auditor General of the Federation, Accountant General of the Federation, and surveyor General of the Federation.\\n4. Government should ensure that credit from Bank of Industries is given to engineers with minimal or zero interest rate, to encourage engineering, and National Industrialization.\\n5. There should be an order of mandamus, from the office of the Engineer General of the Federation to companies operating in Nigeria to as a matter of obligation, to engage undergraduate engineer during his period of internship to improve his engineering experience with stipend to offset the cost of his logistics.\\n\\nFrom,\\nGraduate Engineer, Abbah Rufus.\\n\\nPlease Note:\\n\\nIf you are an undergraduate engineer,\\n graduate engineer, or you like engineering.\\n Help me share this piece until it gets to the government.\\n06/12/2017, 08:08 - Mr. Geoff: Copied shaa\\nSensible tho\\n07/12/2017, 09:40 - \\u202a+234 806 598 6668\\u202c: U                  u   nnñ\\n07/12/2017, 11:07 - Ipe Balo: Happy belated birthday ben🎊🎊\\n07/12/2017, 18:05 - Ipe Ben: Thanks balo\\n07/12/2017, 21:00 - Mr. Geoff: Whatever u strtd smoking newly, u need to stop it ASAP!\\n07/12/2017, 21:01 - IPE Course Rep: Hehe I think its important\\n08/12/2017, 00:28 - IPE Harrison: Lol\\n08/12/2017, 07:23 - \\u202a+234 806 909 0717\\u202c left\\n08/12/2017, 07:18 - IPE OGE: Lol\\n09/12/2017, 05:47 - Ipe Jennifer changed the subject from \"Happy birthday big ben! 🍾\" to \"Class of 2017 👩🏻\\u200d🎓👨🏻\\u200d🎓😍💋\"\\n09/12/2017, 05:48 - Ipe Jennifer changed this group\\'s icon\\n09/12/2017, 10:47 - Ipe K.

I gladly appreciate the team\\'s spirited effort, cooperation, coordination, hard work, tenacity and team work which yielded this excellent performance.\\n\\nI\\'m proud of you all for a job well done. As your hard work has truly paid off in this project, we look forward to achieving a landmark success in the 2017/2018 NPFL season. Congratulations!\\n\\nI wish to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who worked towards the actualization and success of this tournament. May I also use this medium to thank High Chief Emeka Inyama for initiating this project which, I, gladly accepted to host, Mr Patrick Ngwaogu, who coordinated the tournament, ensuring its eventual success as well as the Chairman of FC Ifeanyi Ubah, Mr. Chukwuma Ubah who saw to it that the visiting teams were taken care of in the most hospitable manner.

Thieves can no longer spend wastefully. \\n\\nThe private school owners are shouting because parents can no longer pay outrageous sums and are withdrawing their wards. \\n\\nI was shocked when I learnt that in a popular private University in Abuja, parents are writing undertaking at the account section for their children to be allowed to write exams... and it goes on and on.\\n\\nThe fact is, a lot of people are returning to what someone referred to as \\'\\'default mode\\'\\'.\\n\\nWe mostly have been living above our REAL MEANS. \\n\\nWe have been staying in houses that ordinarily our incomes can\\'t afford. \\n\\nOur children going to schools we can\\'t afford. Driving cars we ordinarily can\\'t maintain.\\n\\nWe have been living a FAKE LIFE all along. Now the reality is before us and we don\\'t want to accept it. \\n\\nThis shows how morally bankrupt we are.\\n\\nYou can\\'t eat your Cake and have it. Take Note...\"GOD HELP AND BLESS NIGERIA\"\\n\\nYou got billions from bank without collateral using your political influence. You put half into your business and spent the other half on exotic cars, jeweleries, etc. \\n\\nYour business employs 100 people normally. You get illegal waivers and concessions to import raw materials at rock bottom prices, you get over-inflated contract to supply government some goods your company produce....in short your company is kept afloat by corruption.\\n\\nNow the new SHERIFF in town says: \\n\\nno more ridiculous waivers, \\nno more inflated contracts, no more bank loans without collateral, in fact its time you or your company pay off the billions of debt owed.....\\n\\nAMCON takes over your company, staff are laid off......And you go on air and say the new sheriff is killing business and causing unemployment..\\n\\nThe truth is....you and your company were never in business, you were only feeding off the system. \\n\\nToo many companies and banks are funded by corruption. Remove corruption from the system and they collapse.......and we end up blaming the person that removes corruption for the collapse of the corruptly run fake company.\\n\\nIts like our system and corruption are so interwoven and inseparable that removing one will kill the other. \\n\\nMaybe we should tolerate and learn to live with corruption so that Nigeria can survive? \\n\\nRecession: What recession? If you think Nigeria is broke, then you are living in another planet. Now, please read the information below and tell me why Nigerians crying of hardship are comfortable with the bold looting of their collective wealth by the politicians. \\n\\nA SELF DECEIVING COUNTRY CALLED NIGERIA \\n\\nTwenty-one senators currently receiving pensions from government as ex-governors and deputy governors.\\n\\nThe current senators who once served as governors are Bukola Saraki of Kwara, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of Kano, Kabiru Gaya of Kano, Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom, Theodore Orji of Abia, Abdullahi Adamu of Nasarawa, Sam Egwu of Ebonyi, Shaaba Lafiagi of Kwara, Joshua Dariye of Plateau Jonah Jang of Plateau, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko of Sokoto, Ahmed Sani Yarima of Zamfara, Danjuma Goje of Gombe, Bukar Abba Ibrahim of Yobe, Adamu Aliero of Kebbi, George Akume of Benue and Isiaka Adeleke of Osun. \\n\\nThe  former deputy governors in the Senate are Ms Biodun Olujimi of Ekiti and Enyinaya Harcourt Abaribe of Abia. Danladi Abubakar Sani served as the acting governor of Taraba state.\\n\\nMany former governors are also in Buhari\\'s Cabinet as Ministers. This includes: Ngige, Fayemi, Amaechi and Fashola (SAN).).\\n\\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the law provides that ex governors and deputy governors receive pension equivalent to the salaries of the incumbent. The package also includes a new official car and a utility vehicle every four years; one personal aide; a cook, chauffeurs and security guards for the governor at a sum not exceeding N5 million per month and N2.5 million for his deputy governor.\\n\\nIn Rivers, the law provides 100 percent of annual basic salaries for the ex-governor and deputy, one residential house for the former governor “anywhere of his choice in Nigeria”; one residential house anywhere in Rivers for the deputy, three cars for the ex-governor every four years and two cars for the deputy every four years. \\n\\nIt is alledged that in Lagos, a former governor will get two houses, one in Lagos and another in Abuja, estimated at N500 million in Lagos and N700 million in Abuja. He also receives six new cars to be replaced every three years; a furniture allowance of 300 percent of annual salary to be paid every two years, and a N30 million pension annually for life.\\n\\nThis is the reality for all the 21 ex govenors and deputy governors who are currently serving as senators. This same is also true of ex governors who are now serving as Ministers.\\n\\nNOW I ASK: \\nHow many years did these guys serve their states as governors and deputy governors? Is it more than 8years? Is that a reason to be entitled to pensions for life? Even if they are entitled to pension for life, must it be so outrageous?\\n\\nAs if that is not enough: HOW on earth can any public servant with conscience collect salaries and allowances as a senator or minister, and still have the audacity to claim pensions equivalent to the salaries of a serving governor in Nigeria?\\n\\nIT ISN\\'T ROCKET SCIENCE......\\n\\nOnce you are elected a senator or appointed a minister, you must forfeit any pension accruing to you from government at any level until you vacate office. This should also apply to senators collecting military pensions like former Senate President David Mark.\\n\\nYet these senators are in the Senate that is inviting the current finance minister to discuss the recession of Nigeria\\'s economy. A senator pockets approximately 30 million naira monthly as salary and allowances. Our \"honourables\" are not interested to make laws that could restructure our country into economically autonomous federating States/Regions to save the country from sectional agitations that is threatening  to destroy Nigeria. The sad and hopeless situation is that the rest of Nigerians are busy arguing based on party, ethnic and affiliations while these enemies of state continue to rape us.\\n\\nDo you know that it costs tax payers 290m Naira yearly to maintain each member of our National Assembly in a country where nothing works & 80% of population earn below 300 Naira a day ? A working day earning of a senator is more than a yearly income of a doctor; it\\'s more than the salary of 42 Army generals or 48 professors or 70 commissioners of police or more than twice the pay of the US President or 9 times the salary of US congressmen. \\n\\nIt\\'s high time the country had a referendum on those outrageous salaries of Senators, House of Representative members and other political office holders.\\n\\n*If you are seriously against the looting of our commonwealth in Nigeria, in the name of democracy, you can let this piece go viral by sharing it with as many of your contacts and groups too!*\\n\\n##FORWARDED AS RECEIVED\\n14/12/2017, 07:08 - Ipe Phyno: Take a bank for example, they sell a package which pays back 40% profit if you put $60 in your account, so more like you borrow a bank your $60 and you guys have an agreement that you will be lending the bank your $60 for 140 working days and the bank agrees that they will pay you back your $60 plus 40% profit in these 140 days, so they agree to pay you 1% profit back every working day for 140 days.  (Which makes the investment a 140% return on investment. Your 100% is your $60 back to you and the 40% is the profit you get)\\nAnd the good thing is that you can buy as much packages as you want, so you can have 10-20 packages, each paying you back 140% so you can imagine how much profit you can make with buying more packages. \\nAnd the sweetest part is that you get paid all of these in bitcoin, so when bitcoin prices go up in the market you get more 1% interest daily.  And at the end you sell off all these bitcoin at whatever current selling price of bitcoin in the market at that period.\\n14/12/2017, 07:08 - Ipe Phyno: And not just that, every time you recommend someone and they buy a package you get an additional 10% from their package, which is 10% of $60,  you get $6 each time they buy a package.  And remember, all in bitcois. \\nThe bank in this question is USI-TECH, which is a bitcoin mining company. Authentic. You may confirm. Bitcoin miners get paid to mine bitcoin and process transactions.\\n14/12/2017, 07:08 - Ipe Phyno: <Media omitted>\\n14/12/2017, 07:09 - Ipe Phyno: Do the conversion and see the equivalent of that value.

Our generation has been infected with spiritual leprosy. Sin is a kind of leprosy that has become the culture of the children of God. Leprosy is a contagious disease that makes one unclean. Who is suffering from leprosy is tagged with stigma.\\n\\nChristians of our time are suffering from spiritual leprosy. They are alienated from the presence of God because of the odour of their sin. They are uncomfortable in the presence of holy people because their lives is untouched by the gospel. They are smelling spiritually. They infect others with this wicked disease. \\n\\nNowadays, many families are infected by the disease of the spiritual leprosy. Our country is is suffering from spiritual leprosy. Children of God are suffering from this problem. Some of you are already comfortable in this kind of leprosy. \\n\\nWe are admonished to identify the level of spiritual leprosy eating our spiritual treasuries and approach Jesus for forgiveness, healing and deliverance. Jesus has given us hope today. He is inviting you to have a healing encounter with him. Come close to Jesus, he will heal you. Come close to Jesus, he will deliver you. Come close to Jesus, he will forgive you. I urge you my beloved friends to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your soul \\'(1 Peter 2:11).\\nUzochukwu Kizito (P.

Thus is due to the fact that, the recently passed out batch A, stream 1 ,2017 will still collect allowance for this month of April. Thus, a new date of 24 April has been set for batch A stream 1 , 2018. This will make them be able to pay May allowance in camp and avoid April double payment. 2018 batch A ,stream 1 will be able to print call up letters by Thursday 19 of April , 2018.

One day, they went hunting and a wild animal attacked the king, the servant managed to kill the animal but couldn\\'t prevent his majesty from losing a finger. Furious and without showing gratitude, the King said; if God was good, I would not have been attacked and lost one finger. The servant replied, \\'despite all these things, I can only tell you that God is good and everything He does is perfect, He is never wrong\\'. Outraged by the response, the king ordered the arrest of his servant. While being taken to prison, he told the king again, God is Good & Perfect. Another day, the king left alone for another hunt and was captured by savages who use human beings for sacrifice. On the altar, the savages found out that the king didn\\'t have one finger in place, he was released because he was considered not \"complete\" to be offered to the gods. On his return to the palace, he ordered the release of his servant and said; My friend, God was really good to me. I was almost killed but for lack of a single finger, I was let go. But I have a question; If God is so good, why did He allow me to put you in prison? His servant replied; My king, if I had not been put in prison, I would have gone with you, and would have been sacrificed, because I have no missing finger. Everything God does is perfect, He is never wrong. Often we complain about life, and the negative things that happen to us, forgetting that everything happens for a purpose. God knows why you are reading this message today, please bless someone with it by sharing it. God is good and perfect!! My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude. When you look at your life, career, job or family life, what do you say? Do you praise God? Do you blame the Satan? A good attitude towards God makes Him move on your behalf. Just sit down and say, Today , I am thankful I had a peaceful sleep, I am thankful I am alive with possibilities, I am thankful I have a roof over me, I am thankful I have a job, I am thankful that I have Family and Friends. Above all, I am thankful that I have God in my life . Be blessed and don\\'t be envious or shocked when others are prospering because you don\\'t know what they have been through to get there (test, trials and tribulation) so thank God for what you have. \"Little is much when God is in it. It Is Well With God\\'s grace. Touch someones life with this message if God is for us, who can be against us? Don\\'t read if you can\\'t forward. God has seen you struggling with something. God says it\\'s over. A blessing is coming your way. If you believe in God send this message on, please don\\'t ignore it, God is going to fix two things (BIG) in your favor. If you believe in God, drop everything and pass it on. Today will be the best day of your life.
